# Dan-McKay-Personal-Portfolio

This README file is for weekly challenge assignment #2 for the UC Berkeley Coding Boot Camp, in which I create a website from scratch using html and css and image assets.

* Per the challenge instructions, I created a portfolio site containing my name, a recent photo, and self-explanatory sections for bio, contact info, work, and resume

* I also included anchor tags so that there would be links at the top of the page that jumped to the bottom

* I also included coding comments in the html and css files to make the code more understandable

* I included images and styling elements to make the page more visually appealing and readable

* I also used CSS to make elements resize and/or move functionally to fit the size of the browser

* I don't have past coding experience, but I did include a link to my first weekly challenge website, as well as my last place of work and my general GitHub page.

* Finally the site itself should be reachable at https://danielfmckay.github.io/Dan-McKay-Personal-Portfolio/
  (at least whenever it gets through GitHub's deployment queue)
